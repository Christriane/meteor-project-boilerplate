# Boilerplate Meteor Project

A simple Meteor boilerplate setup to get a project up and running quickly. I built this while following Andrew Mead's Meteor/React Udemy Course. This Includes a basic React.js and Auth setup.

```
> git clone https://github.com/Christriane/meteor-project-boilerplate.git

```
